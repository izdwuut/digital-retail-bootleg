# Digital Retail Bootleg
You are looking at the state of the art, hi-end, mumbo-jumbo tool intended to create bootleg executables containing some sort of a license key. I created it with PC games in mind, but I imagine that it would wrap a World of Warcraft pre-paid code just as well... no, according to my knowledge it's a PC game, too. I don't really have much hobbies outside of it. I also seriously doubt that there is any external world. At. All. 

Anyhow, I find it nice if you want to gift your friend with a retail copy of the game but the devs have released it on Steam only. Or if you'd like to put your safeword in there - no judging! The possibilities are endless. Just please don't try to break it too much, as I bet that it would inevitably fail to execute. I didn't care much about error handling. 2018, right? Oh, and I have tested it on Windows only. It works for me. 2018, right?
